# Advent of Code 2018 #

This is an attempt (in 2022) to solve [AoC 2018's](https://adventofcode.com/2018) challenges while continuing to learn Go.

I have included my input data and the test data provided in the AoC rubric. Other than the ability to test solutions against the test data, there are no tests.

Run as follows:
`go run aoc.go <day> <part> path/to/input.txt`
